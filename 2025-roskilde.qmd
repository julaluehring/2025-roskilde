::: notes
-   So when we talk about misinformation, we usually refer to inaccurate information, regardless of the intention.

-   People have a lot of reasons to believe in misinformation, but there is more and more evidence showing that one of the strongest predictors is partisanship

-   Therefore, misinformation is now understood as a symptom of a clustered information ecosystem where few people are exposed to misinformation, while most people have partisan information diets, including decontextualized but not completely inaccurate information

-   In partisan-based information processing, emotions play a very important role

-   While arousing, mobilizing emotions signal us to better select, process and memorize vital information

-   Which, in theory, is good, they can also hinder systematic processing

-   In the case of misinformation, arousing emotions may therefore reinforce partisan-based processing

:::

::: notes
But we also looked at the emotional response as a more immediate measure of emotions and we found more anger and less joy in response to the false items

However, we also included some open-ended items and we found that people reacted with disbelief, they said things like bullshit or nonse

So here in this plot you can see a non-linear relationship between discernment and anger, and we can see that people who were really good at discerning true from false and the ones who were really bad at it got angry

Therefore, the function of emotions depends on prior beliefs and it mediates the effect of misinformation

# Misinformation on social media

## Collective dynamics

-   Moralizing & arousing content gets high engagement

-   Misinformation: conflict, negative, distrustful

    -   **but** only 0.3-6% in 5 studies from 2016-2021
    -   elite and partisan superspreaders

::: notes
-   On social media, arousing emotions attract attention and higher engagement, reflecting a function of emotions, namely grabbing attention

-   Content that is highly arousing and negative gets higher engagement, typically, this is moralizing and conflictual content

-   So we would also expect misinformation to be embedded in such emotional dynamics, anger, and intergroup hate

-   Where a major concern is not just how many people believe in it but secondary effects, such as loss in trust, growing affective polarization, and so on.
:::

# What are effects of misinformation on online interactions?

::: notes
-   Therefore, we were wondering what the effects of misinformation are on online discussions, do they trigger conflict and anger, and does this then lead to higher engagement?
:::

## There are problems

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}

1.    Misinformation is measured as clearly true or false instances,

-   neglecting less extreme types,

-   making it hard to isolate effects of misinformation.

:::

::: {.column width="48%"}

::: fragment 

2.    Different effects of emotions are overlooked by

-   mixing up timings of emotions,

-   ignoring the function of emotions,

-   measuring positive and negative sentiment only.

:::

::: notes
We identified two problems that we wanted to tackle in this study

-   First, misinformation is often measured as clearly false, fact-checked instances, which ignores less extreme and more influential types of misinformation, for instance biased news, and it makes it hard to isolate the effects from real news

    -   So the question is, are the effects that we are observing unique to misinformation?

-   Second, emotions are functional; and the function of emotions hinges on the interaction of prior beliefs and content. Therefore, measuring only positive and negative sentiment, or mixing up emotional state with emotional reactions overlooks the contextual effects of different emotions.

## Our objectives

::: {.column width="50%"}

1.  Collecting a **systematic, large-scale and long-term data set** for the German-speaking context

### Continuous trustworthiness ratings by NewsGuard (#1)

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
2.  Approximating **causal inference** to test the effects of misinformation on different emotions

### Non-parametric matching strategy (#2)
:::
:::
:::

::: notes
So, we derived 2 major objectives:

-   First, we wanted to collect a systematic, large-scale and long-term dataset that relies on continuous trustworthiness ratings for sources, including biased but relatively trustworthy sources so that it reflects the whole spectrum of news trustworthiness

-   Second, we tried a matching approach to approximate causal inference so that we could isolate the effects of untrustworthy sources

:::

::: notes
-   For each tweet, we then classified 8 distinct emotions from text
-   This plot shows the covered time frame from October 2020 to March 2022 and we can already see that anger is overall much higher

## Effects on engagement

$\uparrow$ **more** retweets for tweets with untrustworthy links

$\downarrow$ but **fewer** likes & replies

## Effects on emotions

![OLS regression models (bootstrapped CIs)](images/effects_emotions.png){width="500"}

$\uparrow$ **more** anger, disgust and fear 

$\downarrow$ and **less** joy in response to untrustworthy sources

## Conclusions

-   Sources with lower trustworthiness get unique engagement 

      - but reach is overall limited

-   Sources with low trustworthiness predict anger & other negative emotions 

      - but emotions in discussions largely reflect emotions in initial post


# Current project

## Analyzing a Twitter panel of Austrian users

-   timeline of 30k Austrian Twitter users (200M tweets)
-   classification of emotions, topics, trustworthiness, (issue stance)
-   linkage with survey data from the [ACPP](https://viecer.univie.ac.at/coronapanel/)

### Questions

What are differences between user groups?

What is the temporal development before/after engagement with misinformation?

$\rightarrow$ uncertainty/anxiety, frustration, group identity, belief networks
